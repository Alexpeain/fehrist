"Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds" is a memoir and self-help book written by David Goggins, co-authored with Adam Skolnick. The book is an inspiring and motivational account of Goggins' life journey, from a troubled and overweight young man to becoming one of the world's most elite endurance athletes and a Navy SEAL.

The book is divided into two main sections. The first section delves into Goggins' challenging upbringing, marked by poverty, abuse, and personal struggles. He shares stories of his troubled childhood and the mental and physical hardships he faced. Despite these obstacles, Goggins found the determination and inner strength to transform himself into a Navy SEAL, a U.S. Army Ranger, and an ultra-endurance athlete.

The second section of the book provides practical advice and strategies for personal growth and self-improvement. Goggins emphasizes the power of mental resilience and self-discipline. He introduces the concept of the "Accountability Mirror," which involves taking an honest look at one's own life and making the necessary changes to achieve one's goals. Goggins also discusses the "40% Rule," which suggests that when you feel like you're at your limit, you've actually only tapped into a small fraction of your potential.

Throughout the book, Goggins shares his experiences participating in grueling endurance events, such as ultramarathons and Navy SEAL training, to demonstrate the mental toughness required to overcome physical and emotional challenges.

"Can't Hurt Me" is a story of personal transformation and empowerment, highlighting the idea that one can break through their self-imposed limits by mastering their mind and embracing discomfort. It's a compelling and motivational read that encourages readers to push beyond their perceived boundaries and pursue their goals with unwavering determination.
