The novel opens with the arrival of a train from Pakistan, carrying the bodies of massacred Hindus and Sikhs. This event plunges the fictional village of Mano Majra, which is located on the border of India and Pakistan, into a state of fear and uncertainty. The Sikhs and Muslims of Mano Majra, who have lived together peacefully for many years, are now divided by religious hatred.

The novel follows a number of characters, including:

- *Juggut Singh*, a Sikh dacoit who is in love with Nooran, a Muslim woman.
- *Iqbal Singh*, a Sikh political worker who is trying to prevent violence between the Sikhs and Muslims.
- *Meet Singh*, a Sikh religious leader who is stoking the flames of hatred.
- *Imam Baksh*, Nooran's father and the village mullah.
- *Malli*, a Muslim peasant who is tortured and killed by the Sikhs.
- *Juggut Singh* is a complex and conflicted character. He is a Sikh, but he is also a dacoit, which means that he is an outlaw. He is in love with Nooran, but he knows that their relationship is forbidden. Juggut Singh is also a man of violence, but he is also capable of great kindness and compassion.

Iqbal Singh is a Sikh political worker who is trying to prevent violence between the Sikhs and Muslims. He is a rational and intelligent man, but he is also struggling to maintain his faith in humanity in the face of the hatred and violence that is taking place around him.

Meet Singh is a Sikh religious leader who is stoking the flames of hatred against the Muslims. He is a fanatic who believes that the Sikhs are the only true people of Mano Majra. Meet Singh is also a power-hungry man who is trying to take advantage of the chaos and uncertainty of the Partition to consolidate his own power.

Imam Baksh is Nooran's father and the village mullah. He is a wise and compassionate man who is trying to protect his family and his community from the violence that is taking place around them. Imam Baksh is also a man of faith who believes in the power of love and understanding to overcome hatred and division.

Malli is a Muslim peasant who is tortured and killed by the Sikhs. He is a symbol of the innocent victims of the Partition. Malli's death is a turning point in the novel, as it forces Juggut Singh to confront the violence that he has helped to create.

The novel comes to a tragic climax when the Sikhs of Mano Majra massacre the Muslim refugees who are waiting to board the train to Pakistan. Juggut Singh is forced to confront the violence that he has helped to create, and he ultimately chooses to die alongside Nooran.

Train to Pakistan is a powerful and moving novel that explores the human cost of the Partition of India and Pakistan. It is a novel that is still relevant today, as it warns us about the dangers of religious hatred and intolerance.
